## Problem 1: Writing Tests and Readable code

In the testing-problem directory, you will find a simple class called CrazyList.ts 
with an extremely easy function to implement. You will also see a test file
with one test already written. Please implement the function and write all 
the tests you'd want to see if this were were an actual production class. 
We want to see how you code.

You may need to install jest, babel, etc. Instructions for that can be
found [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript)

## Problem 2: Generalize and Improve UI

We're providing a React app that uses MUI to display a simple table. The
table displays a set of census data for all 39 counties in Washington
State. Please add a dropdown of all 50 states and make the page display the
appropriate state's county data whenever you change the dropdown. Then spend 
30-45 minutes improving the general look and feel. 

`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
